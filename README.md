# anime-recommendation
2021/22 Data Management project @ University of Milano-Bicocca

## Goal 
Our goal is to create a graph database containing information about most of the existing anime (about 15000) that can be useful to build a content-based anime recommendation system.

## Sources
We will use two different sources:
* [API](https://aniapi.com "AniAPI");
* [Web Scraping](https://myanimelist.net/ "My Anime List").
