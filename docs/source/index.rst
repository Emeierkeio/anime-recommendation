anime-recommendation's documentation
================================================

**anime-recommendation** is our Data Management project at University of Milano-Bicocca.

Goal
-----

Our goal is to create a graph database containing information about most of the existing anime (about 15000) that can be useful to build a content-based anime recommendation system.

Sources
--------

We will use two different sources:
   • API from https://aniapi.com;
   • Web Scraping obtained from https://myanimelist.net/.
